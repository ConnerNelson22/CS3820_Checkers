## Piece and Position Evaluation: evaluate_piece() and POSITION_VALUES help assess each piece's value
## Minimax with Adaptive Depth: The minimax() function is used to decide the best move. The adijust_difficulty() function adapts the minimax search depth based on the AI's performance relative to the player
## Explanation of Moves: explain_move() provides an explanation for each move, printed in select_best_move()
## Game Loop: The game_loop() function simulates turn-based sequence for the AI and player moves
